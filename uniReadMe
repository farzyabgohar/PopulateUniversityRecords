Program purpose: 
	To populate an array of people at Carleton University that are either Employees or Students, and providing the 		user with an option to either:
		1. print the records of all students
		2. print the records of all employees
		3. search a student record by family name
		4. or provide a summary of all the records

Program limitations/issues:
	The program is only able to display upto 20 records (made up of both employees and students)
	When searching student by family name, the search term's first letter must be capital, or else the record will not be found (e.g "Smith" will return a match but "smith" will not)
	The program will keep running until the user quits
	The populated array of people at Carleton University will be the same each iteration of the loop

Example output:
	Once the menu has loaded, if the user picks option 2, the records of all students will be displayed
